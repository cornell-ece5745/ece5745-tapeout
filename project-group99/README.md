# project-group99
This is the code repository for your ECE 5745 assignment. 

You will use this repository to collaborate with your group members, run continuous integration tests, and submit each assignment.  GitHub Actions Continuous Integration We will be using GitHub Actions as our continuous integration service. Continuous integration means all of the tests for your repository will be run automatically every time you push to this repository. The current status of these tests is shown as an image at the top of the README. If the image says "failing" then your repository is currently failing one or more tests; if the image says "passed" then your repository is passing all tests. You can click on the image or on the following direct link to go to the GitHub Actions build report to find out more about which tests are passing or failing.

GitHub and Academic Integrity Violations Students are explicitly prohibited from sharing their code with anyone that is not within their group or on the course staff. This includes making public forks or duplicating this repository on a different repository hosting service. Students are also explicitly prohibited from manipulating the Git history or changing any of the tags that are created by the course staff. The course staff maintain a copy of all repositories, so we will easily discover if a student manipulates a repository in some inappropriate way. Normal users will never have an issue, but advanced users have been warned.  Sharing code, manipulating the Git history, or changing staff tags will be considered a violation of the Code of Academic Integrity. A primary hearing will be held, and if found guilty, students will face a serious penalty on their grade for this course. More information about the Code of Academic Integrity can be found here:
